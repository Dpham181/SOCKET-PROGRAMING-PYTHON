# Specifications
# The server shall be invoked as:
# python serv.py <PORT NUMBER>
# <PORT NUMBER> specifies the port at which ftp server accepts connection requests. For example: python serv.py 1234
# The ftp client is invoked as:
# cli <server machine> <server port>
# <server machine> is the domain name of the server (ecs.fullerton.edu). This will be converted into 32 bit IP address using DNS lookup. For example: python cli.py ecs.fullerton.edu 1234
# Upon connecting to the server, the client prints out ftp>, which allows the user to execute the following commands.
# ftp> get <file name> (downloads file <file name> from the server)
# ftp> put <filename> (uploads file <file name> to the server)
# ftp> ls (lists files on the server)
# ftp> quit (disconnects from the server and exits)
